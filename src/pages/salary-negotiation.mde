<div>
  Check out comparable salaries on websites such as Glassdoor or Angelist. If you have the opportunity to get other forms of compensation like equity and don't know what to ask for, go on a website such as Angelist, and try to look for companies in similar industries at similar sizes and stages for similar positions and see what they are offering. Look at comparable positions to see what is being offered out there.

<div>Naturally don't offend, but be aggressive and check your imposter syndrome at the door if you have it. You should probably always negotiate.</div>
