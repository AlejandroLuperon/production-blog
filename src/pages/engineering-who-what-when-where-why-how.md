I have found that when I talk with people about engineering methodology, approach, and organization,
one of three things tend to happen:

<ul>
  <li>They get sleepy</li>
  <li>They get get anxious</li>
  <li>They seem unsure</li>
</ul>

While I'm certain I can express myself in a more clear, concise, and fun way, I have come to a conclusion that
most of the many different paths that people take to white-collar industries like technology don't necessarily encourage
thinking about how to collaborate or strategize to accomplish a goal or complete a project outside of superficial and abstract introductions to "Agile Methodlogy" or "Problem Solving".

In industry, pretty much every problem, project, and endeavor you encounter will be inherently interdisciplinary, and
many, if not all aspects of what it is that you are working on will require multiple disciplines and skill sets. Interdisciplinary endeavors will thus, naturally require collaboration and possibly benefit from some kind of agreed upon roadmap or set of rules to facilitate information-sharing and the implementing of a solution. Thus, any problem-solving model or organizational structure that restricts collaboration or <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/silo-mentality.asp">'silos'</a> different teams that own different responsibilities to achieve a goal will be more likely to operate less efficiently.

Let's say you are a UX designer on a team in which all information and deliverables related to a project come from a manager, and that manager is your sole point-of-contact in the project.
