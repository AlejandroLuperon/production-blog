I have found that when I talk with people about engineering methodology, approach, and organization,
one of three things tend to happen:

<ul>
  <li>They get sleepy</li>
  <li>They get get anxious</li>
  <li>They seem unsure</li>
</ul>

<p>While I'm certain I could have expressed myself in a more clear, concise, and fun way, I have come to a conclusion that
most of the many different paths that people take to white-collar industries like technology don't necessarily encourage
thinking about how to collaborate or strategize to accomplish a goal or complete a project outside of superficial and abstract introductions to "Agile Methodology" or "Problem Solving".</p>

<p>In industry, pretty much every problem, project, and endeavor you encounter will be inherently interdisciplinary, and many, if not all aspects of what it is that you are working on will require multiple disciplines and skill sets. Interdisciplinary endeavors will require collaboration and possibly benefit from some kind of agreed upon roadmap or set of rules to facilitate information-sharing and the implementing of a solution. Thus, any problem-solving model or organizational structure that restricts collaboration or <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/silo-mentality.asp">'silos'</a> different teams that own different responsibilities to achieve a goal will be more likely to operate less efficiently.</p>

<p>If you are working on a team in which there is one or a select few people who have sole possession over much of the information on the current state of a project or endeavor, then you become dependent upon them for the necessary information you need to be able to move forward or unblock yourself. A lack of knowledge-sharing, or no structure to encourage that, results in workflow bottlenecks.</p>

<p>When working on a problem or a goal, it's definitely important to understand why it is you are working towards solving that problem. Why is it even a problem in the first place? Or why is an enhancement to the current approach meaningful?</p>

<p>If there is already a process or solution in place, learn about that current process. Who are the people affected? Who are the constituents that implement and manage the process? What are the different domains in place (engineers, domain experts, marketers)?</p>

<p>Whether or not you have a process in place, look into the state of the art. How is this problem currently being solved in other companies, both inside and outside of your industry.</p>

<p>If you don't have a domain expert on the particular problem available, do what you can to consult with one and do as much research as time allows to enable you to get up to speed on the particular nuances you may need to learn more about.</p>
