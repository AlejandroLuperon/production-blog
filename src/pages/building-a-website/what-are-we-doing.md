<p>Growing up, I loved baseball. I would try to get my hands on as many stats as possible. I would scavenge <a href="www.mlb.com">mlb.com</a> and <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/">baseball reference</a> in search of any factoid I didn't know.</p>
<p>We are going to be building a baseball website. The dataset is courtesy of journalist <a href="http://www.seanlahman.com/">Sean Lahman</a> and can be found <a href="http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/">here</a>. I will upload the dataset to a MySQL database, tie in an API to it, query it, and enable searching via a user interface.</p>
